## Executive Summary

The AI Learning Platform represents a significant advancement in artificial intelligence education, providing universities with a powerful tool to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation. The platform combines enterprise-grade GPU computing resources with an intuitive educational interface, enabling students to gain hands-on experience with real-world AI development workflows.

## Educational Context and Impact

### Transforming AI Education

Traditional AI education often faces significant challenges in providing students with practical experience. Our platform transforms how students learn AI by providing a complete, hands-on learning environment that mirrors real-world AI development workflows.

### Educational Workflow Overview

The platform guides students through a comprehensive AI development process:

1. **Image Import and Preparation**
   Students begin by importing their image data into the platform. The system automatically processes these images through tiling, breaking them into manageable pieces while maintaining their spatial relationships. This step teaches students about data preparation and the importance of proper input formatting for AI systems.

2. **Data Annotation Phase**
   Using an integrated annotation tool based on Django Labeller, students learn to create high-quality training data. This hands-on experience helps them understand the critical role of data labeling in AI development and the importance of annotation quality for model performance.

3. **Training Set Creation**
   Students learn to organize their annotated data into training sets, gaining practical experience in dataset curation and understanding the importance of data organization in AI projects. They can create multiple training sets to experiment with different data combinations.

4. **Model Training**
   The platform handles the complex GPU resource management behind the scenes while students configure and monitor their training processes. They can observe real-time training metrics and learn about:
   - Model configuration and hyperparameters
   - Training optimization
   - Resource utilization
   - Performance evaluation

5. **Inference and Analysis**
   Students can apply their trained models to new images, experiencing the full AI development cycle. They learn about:
   - Model deployment
   - Inference optimization
   - Result analysis
   - Performance metrics

### Computing Infrastructure

    C[GPU Workers] --> B
    D[CPU Workers] --> B
    
    subgraph "Storage Layers"
        B --> E[Project Data]
        B --> F[Training Sets]
        B --> G[Model Artifacts]
        B --> H[Temporary Storage]
    end
```

The storage system provides:
1. **Scalable Data Management**

   - Caching for frequently accessed files

### Computing Infrastructure

The platform combines local computing resources with powerful GPU-enabled virtual machines to provide a comprehensive computing environment:

1. **Local Processing Servers**
   - Configuration: 16 vCores, 16 GB RAM, 160 GB Storage
   - Handles web application hosting
   - Manages user interactions
   - Coordinates resource allocation
   - Processes routine computational tasks

2. **GPU-Enabled Virtual Machines**
   - Hardware Specifications:
     - CPU: 13 cores
     - System Memory: 40 GiB RAM
     - GPU: NVIDIA Tesla V100S
       - 32GB GPU Memory

- Automatically cleans up after task completion

## Workflow Implementation

### Task Distribution System

The platform uses a sophisticated task distribution system built on Celery and RabbitMQ:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as Django App
    participant Queue as RabbitMQ
    participant Worker as Celery Worker
    participant VM as GPU VM
    participant Storage as S3 Storage

    App->>Queue: Submit Task
    Queue->>Worker: Process Request
    Worker->>VM: Initialize GPU
    VM->>Storage: Mount Storage
    
    loop Task Execution
        VM->>Storage: Read/Write Data
        VM->>Worker: Report Progress
        Worker->>App: Update Status
    end
```

This system enables:
1. **Efficient Resource Management**
   - Asynchronous task processing
   - Automatic worker scaling
   - Resource optimization
   - Error handling and recovery

2. **Real-time Monitoring**
   - Progress tracking

    participant GPU

    User->>Django: Configure Training
    Django->>Storage: Prepare Data
    Django->>GPU: Initialize Training
    
    loop Training Process
        GPU->>Storage: Read Batches
        GPU->>GPU: Process Data
        GPU->>Storage: Save Checkpoints
        GPU->>Django: Update Progress
        Django->>User: Show Status

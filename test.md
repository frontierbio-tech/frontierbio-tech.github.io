  caddy:
    image: caddy:2
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - ./Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile

  worker:
    build: ./worker
    depends_on:
      - rabbitmq
    environment:
      - CELERY_BROKER_URL=amqp://admin:mypass@rabbitmq:5672/

  worker-gpu:

```

## 3. Detailed Workflows

### 3.1 Project Creation and Image Import

When a student begins a new project, the system follows this workflow:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Student
    participant Web
    participant App
    participant Worker
    participant Storage

    Student->>Web: Create Project
    Web->>App: Initialize Project
    App->>Storage: Create Directory Structure
    
    Student->>Web: Upload Images
    Web->>App: Process Upload
    App->>Worker: Submit Tiling Task
    Worker->>Worker: Process Images
    Worker->>Storage: Save Tiles
    App->>Student: Display Results
```

The process includes:

1. Project initialization with proper directory structure
2. Image validation and preprocessing
3. Automatic tiling for large images
4. Progress tracking and status updates

### 3.2 Annotation System

The annotation workflow integrates with Django Labeller:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Student
    participant Tool
    participant App
    participant DB

    Student->>Tool: Open Image
    Tool->>Tool: Initialize Canvas
    
    loop Annotation
        Student->>Tool: Create Annotations
        Tool->>App: Save Progress
        App->>DB: Store Data
    end

    Student->>Tool: Finalize
    Tool->>App: Complete Annotations
    App->>DB: Update Status
```

This process ensures:
- Real-time saving of annotations
- Consistent data format
- Quality control measures
- Progress tracking

### 3.3 Training Set Creation

The platform manages training data through a structured process:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Student
    participant App

    participant Storage
    participant DB

    Student->>App: Select Tiles
    App->>App: Validate Selection
    
    Student->>App: Create Training Set
    App->>Worker: Generate Masks
    Worker->>Storage: Save Masks
    
    App->>DB: Store Metadata
    App->>Student: Confirm Creation
```

### 3.4 Model Training Process

The GPU-intensive training process follows this workflow:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Student
    participant App
    participant Queue
    participant Storage
    participant GPU

    Student->>App: Configure Training
    App->>Storage: Upload Data
    App->>Queue: Submit Job
    
    Queue->>GPU: Start Training
    
    loop Training
        GPU->>GPU: Process Epoch
        GPU->>Storage: Save Checkpoint
        GPU->>App: Update Progress
        App->>Student: Show Status
    end
    
    GPU->>Storage: Save Model
    Storage->>App: Transfer Model
    App->>Storage: Cleanup
```

### 3.5 Inference and Analysis

The inference process utilizes trained models:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram

    participant App
    participant Queue
    participant Storage
    participant GPU

    Student->>App: Upload Test Image
    Student->>App: Select Model
    App->>Storage: Upload Image
    App->>Queue: Submit Task

    Queue->>GPU: Run Inference
    GPU->>Storage: Process Results
    Storage->>App: Return Results
    App->>Student: Show Analysis
```

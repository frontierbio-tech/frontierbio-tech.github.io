# Introduction to Studio

Welcome to Studio, a comprehensive platform designed to introduce students to the complete machine learning workflow for microscopy image analysis. This platform guides you through the entire process from data preparation to model application.

## Platform Overview

Studio provides an end-to-end solution for applying artificial intelligence to microscopy image analysis. The platform is structured around four key processes:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Image Tiling] --> B[Annotation]
    B --> C[Training]
    C --> D[Analysis]
```

### Key Components

1. **Image Tiling**: Divide large microscopy images into manageable pieces
2. **Annotation**: Mark features of interest in these tiles
3. **Training Sets**: Organize annotated tiles for machine learning
4. **Model Training**: Train segmentation models on annotated data
5. **Analysis**: Apply trained models to new images for automated analysis

## The Machine Learning Workflow

Understanding the complete workflow is essential for successful AI-driven image analysis:

### 1. Image Tiling Process

Large microscopy images are divided into smaller tiles that are easier to process and annotate.

```mermaid

    A[Upload Large Image] --> B[Process Image]
    B --> C[Divide into Tiles]
    C --> D[Save Tiles]
    D --> E[View Tile Grid]
```

- Upload large source images
- Automatic tiling into standardized pieces
- Consistent organization for further processing

### 2. Annotation and Training Sets

Tiles are manually annotated to identify features of interest, then organized into training sets.

```mermaid

    A[Select Tile] --> B[Draw Annotations]
    B --> C[Assign Classes]
    C --> D[Save Annotations]
    D --> E[Create Training Set]
    E --> F[Organize Tiles for Training]
```

- Draw annotations on tiles using various tools
- Assign classes to annotations
- Group annotated tiles into training sets

### 3. Machine Learning Training

Training sets are used to train segmentation models that can automatically identify features.

```mermaid

    A[Select Training Pipeline] --> B[Configure Job Parameters]
    B --> C[Start Training]
    C --> D[Monitor Progress]
    D --> E[View Training Metrics]
    E --> F[Completed Model]
```

- Configure training parameters
- Train models on annotated data
- Monitor progress and evaluate results

### 4. Image Analysis

Trained models are applied to new images to automatically detect and measure features.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Upload Analysis Image] --> B[Set Resolution]
    B --> C[Select Trained Model]
    C --> D[Run Analysis]
    D --> E[View Segmentation]
    E --> F[Extract Measurements]
```

- Upload new images for analysis
- Apply trained models
- View results and extract measurements
